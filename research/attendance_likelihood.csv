He has a global travel pattern for international events and participates in both traditional and online tournaments hosted by various organizations. However, there is no specific information about his 2026 tournament schedule or any previous activity in Central America, making it uncertain whether he would specifically attend an open tournament in Honduras during Feb/March 2026."
"A",78,"Sevian, Samuel",2688,"USA","🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; ₿ Won crypto prizes before; ✅ Regularly plays opens; 🌍 Global travel pattern","Based on the research, Samuel Sevian is an active grandmaster who regularly participates in open tournaments including Masters events, US Championships, and international competitions like the 2025 Sharjah Masters, demonstrating a willingness to travel globally for chess events. His consistent tournament activity through 2024-2025 and history of competing in diverse locations suggests he maintains an active playing schedule. However, no specific information was found about his 2026 commitments or previous participation in Central American tournaments, making it difficult to assess the likelihood of attendance at a Honduras open tournament in February/March 2026."
"A",78,"Shankland, Sam",2651,"USA","🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; ₿ Won crypto prizes before; ✅ Regularly plays opens; 🌍 Global travel pattern","Based on the research, Sam Shankland appears to be an active chess professional who regularly participates in international tournaments, including open events like the Batumi Chess Open, and has a history of global travel to locations like Tromsø and Miami for competitions. However, he is already committed to the prestigious Tata Steel Chess Tournament in 2026, which typically occurs in January-February and would likely conflict with a February/March tournament in Honduras. Given his status as a top-level grandmaster (rated 2651) and 2018 US Champion, he would more likely prioritize elite invitational events over open tournaments during this period."
"A",76,"Niemann, Hans Moke",2725,"USA","🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; ✅ Regularly plays opens; 🌍 Global travel pattern; 🌎 Has played in Americas","Based on the research, Hans Moke Niemann regularly participates in open tournaments, having won the GRENKE Open and Las Vegas Super Swiss in 2024, and continues active tournament play as of 2026. He demonstrates global travel patterns for chess competitions and maintains a high activity level in international events. However, no specific commitments or travel plans for February/March 2026 were found in the search results, making it impossible to definitively assess his likelihood of attending a tournament in Honduras during that timeframe."
"A",74,"Carlsen, Magnus",2840,"NOR","🎯 Has Chess960 experience; 🎯 Extensive Chess960 history; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; ₿ Won crypto prizes before; ✅ Regularly plays opens","Based on the search results, Magnus Carlsen remains active in competitive chess as of 2026 and has a global travel pattern, but primarily participates in high-profile invitational events like World Championships, Freestyle Chess tournaments, and specialty events rather than open tournaments. While he has demonstrated willingness to travel internationally (including to locations like Qatar), there is no evidence in the search results of him regularly participating in open tournaments, particularly smaller regional events. Given his focus on elite-level competitions and his status as a top-rated player (2840), attendance at an open tournament in Honduras would be highly unlikely unless it offered significant prize money or had special circumstances not typical of standard open events."
"A",73,"Nakamura, Hikaru",2810,"USA","🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; ₿ Won crypto prizes before; ✅ Regularly plays opens; 🌍 Global travel pattern","Based on the research, Hikaru Nakamura actively participates in open tournaments, having won multiple opens in 2025 including the Comet Open ($45,000 prize) and Maritime Open, demonstrating he regularly competes in such events despite his elite status. He travels globally for competitions and remains highly active as of 2026, suggesting he would be willing to consider international open tournaments. However, no specific information was found about his 2026 schedule or any previous activity in Central America, making it impossible to assess the likelihood of him specifically attending a tournament in Honduras during February/March 2026."

However, there is no evidence in his tournament history of participating in Central American events, and top-rated players like Grischuk typically focus on prestigious international championships and major opens rather than smaller regional tournaments. While theoretically possible given his active status, attendance at an open tournament in Honduras would be unusual based on his established tournament patterns."
"A",72,"Navara, David",2635,"CZE","🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; ₿ Won crypto prizes before; ✅ Regularly plays opens; 🌍 Global travel pattern","Based on the research, David Navara appears to be an active tournament player as of 2026 who regularly participates in open events including the FIDE World Cup, German Bundesliga, and the 2024 U.S. National Championships, demonstrating a global travel range. Given his active status, history of international tournament participation including in the Americas, and regular engagement in open tournaments, he would be a plausible candidate for an open chess tournament in Honduras in Feb/March 2026. However, no specific 2026 commitments were found that would indicate conflicts or confirm availability for those dates."
"A",71,"Aronian, Levon",2729,"USA","🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; ✅ Regularly plays opens; 🌍 Global travel pattern; 🌎 Has played in Americas","Based on the search results, Levon Aronian is an active grandmaster who regularly participates in tournaments and has demonstrated global travel patterns, competing in events across the United States, South Africa, and Las Vegas in 2025. However, his recent tournament activity appears focused on high-profile rapid/blitz events and Freestyle Chess Grand Slam tournaments rather than traditional open tournaments. Given his current tournament preferences for premium events and lack of any indication he typically plays in smaller open tournaments, his attendance at an open tournament in Honduras would be unlikely unless there were significant appearance fees or special circumstances involved."

However, as a top-tier player who typically participates in prestigious invitation-only events rather than open tournaments, and with no specific 2026 schedule information available, his attendance at an open tournament in Honduras would be unlikely unless it offered significant prize money or had special circumstances. Elite grandmasters of his caliber generally focus on major international championships and tour events rather than regional open tournaments."
"A",69,"Nepomniachtchi, Ian",2723,"RUS","🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; ₿ Won crypto prizes before; ✅ Regularly plays opens; 🌍 Global travel pattern","Based on the research, Ian Nepomniachtchi is an active top-level grandmaster (World #4) who primarily competes in elite invitational events like the Candidates Tournament and World Championships rather than open tournaments. While he travels globally for competitions and is scheduled to remain active through 2026, his tournament pattern focuses on high-level closed events, making attendance at an open tournament in Honduras unlikely unless it offered significant prize money or had special significance. His status as a two-time World Championship finalist suggests he would typically prioritize more prestigious invitational events over open competitions."

However, his tournament pattern appears focused on prestigious invitational events rather than open tournaments, and as a former World Champion rated 2664, he would likely prioritize elite competitions over open events. While theoretically possible given his active status and global travel history, his participation in an open tournament in Honduras would be unlikely unless it offered significant appearance fees or had special significance."
"A",68,"Leko, Peter",2676,"HUN","🎯 Has Chess960 experience; 🎯 Extensive Chess960 history; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; ✅ Regularly plays opens; 🌍 Global travel pattern","Based on the search results, Peter Leko is an active grandmaster who regularly participates in FIDE events and international tournaments, as evidenced by his 2025 World Cup participation and upcoming events in Oslo and London. However, the search results show he typically plays in major organized events like Grand Chess Tour tournaments rather than general open tournaments, and there is no indication of previous activity in Central America or smaller regional opens. Given his apparent focus on high-level international circuit events and lack of known commitments or travel patterns to that region, his attendance at an open tournament in Honduras would be unlikely without specific invitation or compelling circumstances."

However, as a top-tier elite player who ""consistently ranks among the world's elite,"" he typically competes in high-level international events, team leagues, and championship tournaments rather than open tournaments. While no specific 2026 conflicts were found, an open tournament in Honduras would be unusual for a player of his caliber, making attendance unlikely unless it offers significant prize money or special circumstances."

However, the research indicates he has faced personal challenges in 2026 including thoughts of quitting chess, which could significantly impact his tournament participation. While he has the profile of a player who might consider international open tournaments, the mentioned personal struggles in 2026 create uncertainty about his actual attendance at any tournament during that period."

However, as an elite player currently ranked 8th in the world, he typically competes in high-level FIDE events, Grand Prix tournaments, and invitation-only competitions rather than open tournaments. While he has commitments to the German Bundesliga 2025/26, his specific availability for February/March 2026 is unknown, making his attendance at an open tournament in Honduras unlikely given his typical tournament profile."
"A",66,"Firouzja, Alireza",2759,"FRA","🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; ✅ Regularly plays opens; 🌍 Global travel pattern; 🌎 Has played in Americas","Based on the research, Firouzja is highly active in international chess tournaments, regularly competing in major events across different continents including the Americas (Saint Louis events), and maintains a busy schedule with recent victories in 2024-2025. However, his tournament pattern appears focused on elite invitational events like the Grand Chess Tour, Sinquefield Cup, and major rapid/blitz championships rather than open tournaments. While no specific 2026 schedule conflicts were found, his typical participation in high-level invitational events makes attendance at an open tournament in Honduras unlikely, despite his demonstrated willingness to travel globally for chess competitions."

While the search results show he travels globally for high-level tournaments and Masters events, there is no specific information about his participation in open tournaments or any scheduling conflicts for February/March 2026. His active international competition schedule suggests he could potentially attend such an event, though his typical participation appears to focus on invitation-based Masters tournaments rather than open events."

However, his tournament pattern appears focused on elite-level competitions like FIDE World Championships and major tours rather than typical open tournaments.

His active status and willingness to travel internationally suggest attendance would be possible, though the lack of clear precedent for competing in that region makes it uncertain."

Additionally, no information was found suggesting he typically plays in open tournaments or has traveled to Central America, making Honduras an unusual destination for his established tournament pattern."
"D",-42,"Oparin, Grigoriy",2658,"USA","❌ RETIRED; 🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ✅ Regularly plays opens; 🌍 Global travel pattern; 🌎 Has played in Americas","Based on the search results, Grigoriy Oparin appears to be retired from competitive chess as of 2025, which significantly reduces the likelihood of him attending any tournaments in 2026. While he has previously participated in major international events like the FIDE World Cup and US Championship, and has traveled globally including a move to the United States in 2022, his retired status and commitment to the 2026 FIDE Freestyle Chess World Championship Play-In suggest he would be unlikely to participate in an open tournament in Honduras during Feb/March 2026."
"D",-42,"Gledura, Benjamin",2654,"HUN","❌ RETIRED; 🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; ✅ Regularly plays opens; 📺 Content creator - event is good content","Based on the search results, Benjamin Gledura is described as a retired Hungarian chess grandmaster, which would significantly reduce the likelihood of him traveling to compete in tournaments. However, there appears to be conflicting information as he reportedly participated in multiple tournaments in 2024-2025 including the Hungarian Super League and German Bundesliga, suggesting he may still be active despite the retirement claim. Given that no travel to the Americas was documented in his tournament history and Honduras would represent an unusual destination for a European-based player, attendance at such an event would be unlikely unless there were specific compelling circumstances."
"D",-47,"Svidler, Peter",2682,"FID","❌ RETIRED; 🎯 Has Chess960 experience; 🎯 Extensive Chess960 history; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; ₿ Won crypto prizes before","Based on the search results, Peter Svidler retired from competitive play in 2020 and now focuses on streaming chess on platforms like Twitch and YouTube rather than tournament competition. While he has shown recent activity in specific events like the Jerusalem Masters series and other named tournaments, there is no evidence he participates in open tournaments, and his current engagement appears limited to select invitational events rather than general open competition. Given his retired status from competitive play and apparent focus on streaming/commentary work, attendance at an open tournament in Honduras would be highly unlikely."
"D",-48,"Fedoseev, Vladimir",2705,"SLO","❌ RETIRED; 🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ✅ Regularly plays opens; 🌍 Global travel pattern; 🌎 Has played in Americas","Based on the search results, Vladimir Fedoseev is reportedly retired as of 2026, which would make his attendance at any tournament highly unlikely. While he previously competed at a high international level including events in the Americas (winning the 2024 U.S. National Championships), his typical tournament pattern focused on elite invitation-only events like the Grand Chess Tour rather than open tournaments. Given his retired status and historical preference for top-tier closed tournaments, participation in an open tournament in Honduras would be extremely improbable."
"X",-50,"Adams, Michael",2635,"ENG","❌ RETIRED; 🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; ✅ Occasionally plays opens; 📺 Content creator - event is good content","Based on the research, Michael Adams is a retired English chess grandmaster who remains selectively active in senior championships and international open tournaments, having won the 2025 ECF English Championship and committed to events like the European Senior Team Championship in Poland. While he does participate in open tournaments such as the 3rd Cambridge International Open, his travel patterns appear focused on European events, and there is no indication in his known schedule or typical tournament selection that suggests he would travel to Central America for an open tournament. Given his selective post-retirement activity and apparent preference for regional events, attendance at a Honduras open tournament would be unlikely unless there were exceptional circumstances or incentives not evident in the available information."
"X",-52,"Murzin, Volodar",2652,"FID","❌ RETIRED; 🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ✅ Regularly plays opens; 🌍 Global travel pattern; 📺 Content creator - event is good content","Based on the search results, Volodar Murzin is described as retired and ""no longer competing"" as of 2025, which would make his attendance at any tournament in 2026 unlikely. However, there appears to be conflicting information since he was reportedly scheduled for championships in December 2025 and had recent activity in open tournaments like the IV Menorca Open and Djerba Masters. If he were still active, his pattern of participating in international open tournaments and willingness to travel to diverse locations would suggest he could potentially attend such an event, though no specific 2026 commitments were found in the research."

The information indicates he retired from chess in 2005 due to health issues, despite some conflicting data showing recent tournament participation through 2024-2025. Even if he were active, the search results provide no evidence of him playing in open tournaments or traveling to Central America, as his documented participation appears limited to top-tier invitational events like the Candidates Tournament."
"X",-59,"Anand, Viswanathan",2743,"IND","❌ RETIRED; ⚠️ Has Feb/March 2026 conflict; 🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; ✅ Occasionally plays opens","Based on the search results, Viswanathan Anand is unlikely to attend an open chess tournament in Honduras in Feb/March 2026. He retired from competitive play in 2025 and typically participates in high-level invitational events like Grand Tour tournaments and Masters events rather than open tournaments. Additionally, he already has a scheduling conflict with the Tata Steel India Blitz and Rapid tournament in early 2026."
"X",-59,"Andreikin, Dmitry",2710,"FID","❌ RETIRED; 🎯 Has Chess960 experience; ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection; 📺 Content creator - event is good content; Strong GM (2700-2749) - good fit for prize pool","Based on the search results, Dmitry Andreikin's likelihood of attending an open tournament in Honduras in Feb/March 2026 appears very low. The information indicates he retired from competitive play in 2020, though there are conflicting reports of scheduled activity in 2025 and a notable game against Magnus Carlsen in 2026. No information was found about his history of playing open tournaments or traveling to Central America, and his current activity level remains unclear given the contradictory retirement status and recent tournament mentions."
"X",-72,"Bu, Xiangzhi",2665,"CHN","❌ RETIRED; 🎯 Has Chess960 experience; 📺 Content creator - event is good content; Solid GM (2650-2699) - likely interested","Based on the search results, Bu Xiangzhi's attendance at an open tournament in Honduras in Feb/March 2026 appears highly unlikely. The information indicates he retired from competitive chess in 2021, though there's some conflicting data showing recent activity including winning the 2024 Shenzhen Masters and being scheduled for the 2025 China Chess King tournament. No information was found about his history of playing open tournaments or traveling internationally to smaller events, and there are no known commitments or travel patterns that would suggest participation in a tournament in Honduras."
"X",-72,"Morozevich, Alexander",2653,"RUS","❌ RETIRED; 🎯 Has Chess960 experience; 📺 Content creator - event is good content; Solid GM (2650-2699) - likely interested","Based on the search results, Alexander Morozevich's attendance at an open tournament in Honduras in Feb/March 2026 appears highly unlikely. Although he officially retired from competitive chess in 2015, he has shown some recent activity by participating in the Aeroflot Open 2025 and Russia Team Blitz Chess 2025 in Sochi, suggesting he may selectively participate in events close to home or of particular significance. However, there is no evidence of him traveling to remote locations like Honduras for tournaments, and his limited recent activity appears focused on Russian events."
"X",-76,"Saric, Ivan",2655,"CRO","❌ RETIRED; 🌎 Has played in Americas; 📺 Content creator - event is good content; Solid GM (2650-2699) - likely interested","Based on the search results, Ivan Šarić's attendance at an open tournament in Honduras in Feb/March 2026 appears unlikely. The research indicates he is retired from competitive chess, though there's conflicting information showing recent 2024 tournament participation and a scheduled commitment to Bundesliga 2025/26. Given that his documented tournament history shows participation in high-level European events and major tournaments like the Saint Louis Masters rather than open tournaments, and with no evidence of travel to Central America, a trip to Honduras would represent an unusual departure from his established patterns."
"X",-80,"Tari, Aryan",2637,"NOR","❌ RETIRED; ⚠️ Has Feb/March 2026 conflict; 🎯 Has Chess960 experience; 🌍 Global travel pattern; 🌎 Has played in Americas","Based on the search results, Aryan Tari's attendance at an open tournament in Honduras in Feb/March 2026 appears unlikely due to several factors. The research indicates he retired from competitive chess in 2021, and he already has a commitment to the Pan-Am Intercollegiate tournament in February 2026, creating a scheduling conflict. While he has shown willingness to travel globally for tournaments and has played in the Americas, his apparent retirement status suggests reduced competitive activity despite some recent tournament appearances."
