### Tier A Details

#### 1. Xiong, Jeffery (USA, 2656) - Score: 86

Positives: 🎯 Has Chess960 experience, 🎯 Extensive Chess960 history, ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection, ₿ Won crypto prizes before, ✅ Regularly plays opens, 🌍 Global travel pattern, 🌎 Has played in Americas, 📺 Content creator - event is good content, 🇺🇸 US-based - easier travel

Based on the research, Jeffery Xiong is an active grandmaster who regularly competes in open tournaments including the 2025 U.S. Masters Championship and FIDE Grand Swiss, with his latest tournament just one month ago. He has a global travel pattern for international events and participates in both traditional and online tournaments hosted by various organizations. However, there is no specific information about his 2026 tournament schedule or any previous activity in Central America, making it uncertain whether he would specifically attend an open tournament in Honduras during Feb/March 2026.

---

#### 2. Sevian, Samuel (USA, 2688) - Score: 78

Positives: 🎯 Has Chess960 experience, ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection, ₿ Won crypto prizes before, ✅ Regularly plays opens, 🌍 Global travel pattern, 🌎 Has played in Americas, 📺 Content creator - event is good content, 🇺🇸 US-based - easier travel

Based on the research, Samuel Sevian is an active grandmaster who regularly participates in open tournaments including Masters events, US Championships, and international competitions like the 2025 Sharjah Masters, demonstrating a willingness to travel globally for chess events. His consistent tournament activity through 2024-2025 and history of competing in diverse locations suggests he maintains an active playing schedule. However, no specific information was found about his 2026 commitments or previous participation in Central American tournaments, making it difficult to assess the likelihood of attendance at a Honduras open tournament in February/March 2026.

---

#### 3. Shankland, Sam (USA, 2651) - Score: 78

Positives: 🎯 Has Chess960 experience, ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection, ₿ Won crypto prizes before, ✅ Regularly plays opens, 🌍 Global travel pattern, 🌎 Has played in Americas, 📺 Content creator - event is good content, 🇺🇸 US-based - easier travel

Based on the research, Sam Shankland appears to be an active chess professional who regularly participates in international tournaments, including open events like the Batumi Chess Open, and has a history of global travel to locations like Tromsø and Miami for competitions. However, he is already committed to the prestigious Tata Steel Chess Tournament in 2026, which typically occurs in January-February and would likely conflict with a February/March tournament in Honduras. Given his status as a top-level grandmaster (rated 2651) and 2018 US Champion, he would more likely prioritize elite invitational events over open tournaments during this period.

---

#### 4. Niemann, Hans Moke (USA, 2725) - Score: 76

Positives: 🎯 Has Chess960 experience, ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection, ✅ Regularly plays opens, 🌍 Global travel pattern, 🌎 Has played in Americas, 📺 Content creator - event is good content, 📺 Large following, 🇺🇸 US-based - easier travel

Based on the research, Hans Moke Niemann regularly participates in open tournaments, having won the GRENKE Open and Las Vegas Super Swiss in 2024, and continues active tournament play as of 2026. He demonstrates global travel patterns for chess competitions and maintains a high activity level in international events. However, no specific commitments or travel plans for February/March 2026 were found in the search results, making it impossible to definitively assess his likelihood of attending a tournament in Honduras during that timeframe.

---

#### 5. Carlsen, Magnus (NOR, 2840) - Score: 74

Positives: 🎯 Has Chess960 experience, 🎯 Extensive Chess960 history, ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection, ₿ Won crypto prizes before, ✅ Regularly plays opens, 🌍 Global travel pattern, 🌎 Has played in Americas, 📺 Content creator - event is good content, 📺 Large following | Concerns: ⚠️ Super-elite (2800+) - very selective

Based on the search results, Magnus Carlsen remains active in competitive chess as of 2026 and has a global travel pattern, but primarily participates in high-profile invitational events like World Championships, Freestyle Chess tournaments, and specialty events rather than open tournaments. While he has demonstrated willingness to travel internationally (including to locations like Qatar), there is no evidence in the search results of him regularly participating in open tournaments, particularly smaller regional events. Given his focus on elite-level competitions and his status as a top-rated player (2840), attendance at an open tournament in Honduras would be highly unlikely unless it offered significant prize money or had special circumstances not typical of standard open events.

---

#### 6. Nakamura, Hikaru (USA, 2810) - Score: 73

Positives: 🎯 Has Chess960 experience, ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection, ₿ Won crypto prizes before, ✅ Regularly plays opens, 🌍 Global travel pattern, 🌎 Has played in Americas, 📺 Content creator - event is good content, 📺 Large following, 🇺🇸 US-based - easier travel | Concerns: ⚠️ Super-elite (2800+) - very selective

Based on the research, Hikaru Nakamura actively participates in open tournaments, having won multiple opens in 2025 including the Comet Open ($45,000 prize) and Maritime Open, demonstrating he regularly competes in such events despite his elite status. He travels globally for competitions and remains highly active as of 2026, suggesting he would be willing to consider international open tournaments. However, no specific information was found about his 2026 schedule or any previous activity in Central America, making it impossible to assess the likelihood of him specifically attending a tournament in Honduras during February/March 2026.

---

#### 7. Grischuk, Alexander (RUS, 2645) - Score: 72

Positives: 🎯 Has Chess960 experience, ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection, ₿ Won crypto prizes before, ✅ Regularly plays opens, 🌍 Global travel pattern, 🌎 Has played in Americas, 📺 Content creator - event is good content

Based on the research, Alexander Grischuk is an active grandmaster (rated 2645, ranked #73 globally) who regularly participates in open tournaments including the Aeroflot Open and has demonstrated global travel patterns, including recent participation in U.S. tournaments. However, there is no evidence in his tournament history of participating in Central American events, and top-rated players like Grischuk typically focus on prestigious international championships and major opens rather than smaller regional tournaments. While theoretically possible given his active status, attendance at an open tournament in Honduras would be unusual based on his established tournament patterns.

---

#### 8. Navara, David (CZE, 2635) - Score: 72

Positives: 🎯 Has Chess960 experience, ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection, ₿ Won crypto prizes before, ✅ Regularly plays opens, 🌍 Global travel pattern, 🌎 Has played in Americas, 📺 Content creator - event is good content

Based on the research, David Navara appears to be an active tournament player as of 2026 who regularly participates in open events including the FIDE World Cup, German Bundesliga, and the 2024 U.S. National Championships, demonstrating a global travel range. Given his active status, history of international tournament participation including in the Americas, and regular engagement in open tournaments, he would be a plausible candidate for an open chess tournament in Honduras in Feb/March 2026. However, no specific 2026 commitments were found that would indicate conflicts or confirm availability for those dates.

---

#### 9. Aronian, Levon (USA, 2729) - Score: 71

Positives: 🎯 Has Chess960 experience, ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection, ✅ Regularly plays opens, 🌍 Global travel pattern, 🌎 Has played in Americas, 📺 Content creator - event is good content, 🇺🇸 US-based - easier travel

Based on the search results, Levon Aronian is an active grandmaster who regularly participates in tournaments and has demonstrated global travel patterns, competing in events across the United States, South Africa, and Las Vegas in 2025. However, his recent tournament activity appears focused on high-profile rapid/blitz events and Freestyle Chess Grand Slam tournaments rather than traditional open tournaments. Given his current tournament preferences for premium events and lack of any indication he typically plays in smaller open tournaments, his attendance at an open tournament in Honduras would be unlikely unless there were significant appearance fees or special circumstances involved.

---

#### 10. Caruana, Fabiano (USA, 2795) - Score: 70

Positives: 🎯 Has Chess960 experience, ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection, ₿ Won crypto prizes before, ✅ Regularly plays opens, 🌍 Global travel pattern, 🌎 Has played in Americas, 📺 Content creator - event is good content, 🇺🇸 US-based - easier travel

Based on the research, Fabiano Caruana is an active elite grandmaster (world No. 3) who regularly competes in high-profile tournaments like the Grand Chess Tour and World Championships, with recent activity including wins in 2025 and global travel to locations like Qatar. However, as a top-tier player who typically participates in prestigious invitation-only events rather than open tournaments, and with no specific 2026 schedule information available, his attendance at an open tournament in Honduras would be unlikely unless it offered significant prize money or had special circumstances. Elite grandmasters of his caliber generally focus on major international championships and tour events rather than regional open tournaments.

---

#### 11. Nepomniachtchi, Ian (RUS, 2723) - Score: 69

Positives: 🎯 Has Chess960 experience, ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection, ₿ Won crypto prizes before, ✅ Regularly plays opens, 🌍 Global travel pattern, 📺 Content creator - event is good content

Based on the research, Ian Nepomniachtchi is an active top-level grandmaster (World #4) who primarily competes in elite invitational events like the Candidates Tournament and World Championships rather than open tournaments. While he travels globally for competitions and is scheduled to remain active through 2026, his tournament pattern focuses on high-level closed events, making attendance at an open tournament in Honduras unlikely unless it offered significant prize money or had special significance. His status as a two-time World Championship finalist suggests he would typically prioritize more prestigious invitational events over open competitions.

---

#### 12. Kasimdzhanov, Rustam (UZB, 2664) - Score: 69

Positives: 🎯 Has Chess960 experience, ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection, ✅ Regularly plays opens, 🌍 Global travel pattern, 🌎 Has played in Americas, 📺 Content creator - event is good content

Based on the search results, Rustam Kasimdzhanov is an active elite grandmaster who regularly participates in high-level tournaments including the U.S. National Championships, American Cup, and Champions Showdown events, demonstrating both an active tournament schedule and willingness to travel internationally including to the Americas. However, his tournament pattern appears focused on prestigious invitational events rather than open tournaments, and as a former World Champion rated 2664, he would likely prioritize elite competitions over open events. While theoretically possible given his active status and global travel history, his participation in an open tournament in Honduras would be unlikely unless it offered significant appearance fees or had special significance.

---

#### 13. Leko, Peter (HUN, 2676) - Score: 68

Positives: 🎯 Has Chess960 experience, 🎯 Extensive Chess960 history, ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection, ✅ Regularly plays opens, 🌍 Global travel pattern, 📺 Content creator - event is good content

Based on the search results, Peter Leko is an active grandmaster who regularly participates in FIDE events and international tournaments, as evidenced by his 2025 World Cup participation and upcoming events in Oslo and London. However, the search results show he typically plays in major organized events like Grand Chess Tour tournaments rather than general open tournaments, and there is no indication of previous activity in Central America or smaller regional opens. Given his apparent focus on high-level international circuit events and lack of known commitments or travel patterns to that region, his attendance at an open tournament in Honduras would be unlikely without specific invitation or compelling circumstances.

---

#### 14. Vachier-Lagrave, Maxime (FRA, 2734) - Score: 67

Positives: 🎯 Has Chess960 experience, ₿ Has Bitcoin/crypto connection, ✅ Regularly plays opens, 🌍 Global travel pattern, 🌎 Has played in Americas, 📺 Content creator - event is good content

Based on the research, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave is an active French grandmaster (rated 2734) who regularly participates in international tournaments and has demonstrated global travel patterns, including recent participation in U.S. tournaments. However, as a top-tier elite player who "consistently ranks among the world's elite," he typically competes in high-level international events, team leagues, and championship tournaments rather than open tournaments. While no specific 2026 conflicts were found, an open tournament in Honduras would be unusual for a player of his caliber, making attendance unlikely unless it offers significant prize money or special circumstances.

However, his tournament pattern appears focused on elite invitational events like the Grand Chess Tour, Sinquefield Cup, and major rapid/blitz championships rather than open tournaments.
